# This is a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
# print('Hello, World!')

name = 'James'


# If we duplicated the line below and changed name to 'James' ---> name updates with the variable defined above.


# This is string concatenation -> name is added to hello --> ! is added to name
print('Hello, ' + name + '!')
print('Hello, ' + name + '!')
