a: int = 1
b: int = 2

# Comparison Operators ---> used most in programming careers
print(a > b) # Greater than
print(a < b) # Less than
print(a >= b) # Greater than or equal to
print(a <= b) # Less than or equal to
print(a == b) # Equal to
print(a != b) # Not equal to

# Comparison Operators always return boolean values: True or False
# Output:
# False
# True
# False
# True
# False
# True
