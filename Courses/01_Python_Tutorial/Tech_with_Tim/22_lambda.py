# A lambda is a one line anonymous function --> meaning it is not a named function

'''
# To define a lambda we do not use the def keyword instead we use:

x = lambda x: x + 5 # Not the advised way to use the lambda function

# x(2) # Does nothing as we do not do anything with the lambda function

print(x(2)) # Prints the result on the screen

'''

x = lambda x, y: x + y

print(x(2, 32))
