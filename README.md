# Personal Project MYP 5: Learning how to Make Games using Pygame and Python.

### Following is an overview of how this folder is structured and what to expect from each subfolder:

#### 1. Courses: This folder contains the research for the product where you can find the code snippets for each of the tutorials I used for my personal project.

##### Note: The Pygame tutorial folder was downloaded right from the source code as the finished files were provided by the instructor.

#### 2. Backup Projects: This folder contains the backup projects that are functional but do not have all the functionalities.

#### 3. Final Project: This folder contains the final project that is my official game containing all the functionalities.

##### Note: The files shown in these folders are written by me, although there are certain parts where the code shares some resemblance to the code found in the pygame tutorial folder. This is because of how Pygame code is often structured and also because I wanted that specific functionality in my game and so I wrote the exact same code as given in the pygame tutorial folder.

#### 4. Research and Evidence: This folder contains the additional research that I have done and my Personal Project report and it also contains the screenshots that I used for my Personal Project report

#### 5. Terminal Version: This folder contains the terminal version of my game that I created before starting my research for my learning goal as a fun experimental project.

##### Note to myself: Add Personal Project Report and organise this folder.
