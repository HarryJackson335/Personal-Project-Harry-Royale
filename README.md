# Personal Project MYP 5: Learning how to Make Games using Pygame and Python.

### Following is an overview of how this folder is structured and what to expect from each subfolder:

#### 1. Courses: This folder contains the code snippets for each of the tutorials from the courses I used for my personal project.

##### Note: The Pygame tutorial folder was downloaded right from the source code as the finished files were provided by the instructor.

#### 2. Backup Project: This folder contains the backup project that functions like the final game but does not have all the functionalities of the final game.

#### 3. Final Project: This folder contains the final project that is my official game containing all the functionalities.

##### Note: Most of the lines in the files shown in these folders are written by me, although there are certain parts where the code was taken from the pygame tutorial folder.

#### 4. Research and Evidence: This folder contains the additional research that I have done and my Personal Project report and it also contains the screenshots that I used for my Personal Project report

#### 5. Terminal Version: This folder contains the terminal version of my game that I created before starting my research for my learning goal as a fun experimental project.

## How to Play the Game
### In order to play the game, you need to have the following requirements

#### 1. You need to have Python3 installed on your computer
