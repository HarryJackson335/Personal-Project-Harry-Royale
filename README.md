# Personal Project MYP 5: Learning how to Make Games using Pygame and Python.

### Following is an overview of how this folder is structured and what to expect from each subfolder:

#### 1. Courses: This folder contains the research for the product where you can find the code snippets for each of the tutorials I used for my personal project.

##### Note: The Pygame tutorial folder was downloaded right from the source code as the finished files were provided by the instructor.

#### 2. Project: This folder contains the actual product for my personal project which is a Magic Spell Casting Simulator that is inspired by one of the games from the tutorial that is called Monster Battle.

##### Note: The files shown in these folders are written by me, although there are certain parts where the code shares some resemblance to the code found in the pygame tutorial folder because of how Pygame code is often structured.

#### 3. Extra: This folder contains the additional research that I have done and my Personal Project report where you can find the detailed overview of my personal project.

##### Note to myself: Add Personal Project Report and organise this folder.
